# Project: Flashcard-o-matic
A local school has decided to put together a flashcard application, Flashcard-o-matic, to help their students study online. Teachers will use this application to create decks of flashcards for the subjects they teach, and students will study the decks. The school needs you to build the application that the students and teachers will use.

## Instructions
You are tasked with building a number of different screens for the users of the flashcard app, as summarized below:

### Screen	Path	Description

First Header | #2 | #3 
--- | --- | --- 
Home| / | Shows a list of decks with options to create, study, view, or delete a deck
Study | /decks/:deckId/study | Allows the user to study the cards from a specified deck
Create Deck | /decks/new | Allows the user to create a new deck
Deck | /decks/:deckId | Shows all of the information about a specified deck with options to edit or add cards to the deck, navigate to the study screen, or delete the deck
Edit Deck	| /decks/:deckId/edit	| Allows the user to modify information on an existing deck
Add Card |	/decks/:deckId/cards/new	| Allows the user to add a new card to an existing deck
Edit Card |	/decks/:deckId/cards/:cardId/edit	| Allows the user to modify information on an existing card

All of the screens above will work on two common datasets. The datasets are related, and at times, you will need to work with both datasets to get the screens to work properly.


Home
The Home screen is the first page the user sees. It is displayed at /.

Home screen

The Home screen has the following features:

The path to this screen should be /.
A Create Deck button is shown, and clicking it brings the user to the Create Deck screen.
Existing decks are each shown with the deck name, the number of cards, and a Study, View, and Delete button.
Clicking the Study button brings the user to the Study screen.
Clicking the View button brings the user to the Deck screen.
Clicking the Delete button shows a warning message before deleting the deck.
Delete Deck prompt
When the user clicks the Delete button, a warning message is shown and the user can click OK or Cancel. If the user clicks OK, the deck is deleted and the deleted deck is no longer visible on the Home screen.

You can use window.confirm() to create the modal dialog shown in the screenshot below.

Delete Deck prompt

Study
The Study screen is displayed at /decks/:deckId/study.

Study first card

The Study screen has the following features:

The path to this screen should include the deckId (i.e., /decks/:deckId/study).
You must use the readDeck() function from src/utils/api/index.js to load the deck that is being studied.
There is a breadcrumb navigation bar with links to home /, followed by the name of the deck being studied, and finally the text Study (e.g., Home/Rendering In React/Study).
The deck title (i.e., "Study: Rendering in React" ) is shown on the screen.
Cards are shown one at a time, front-side first.
A button at the bottom of each card "flips" it to the other side.
After flipping the card, the screen shows a Next button (see the Next button section below) to continue to the next card.
After the final card in the deck has been shown, a message (see the Restart prompt section below) is shown offering the user the opportunity to restart the deck.
If the user does not restart the deck, they should return to the home screen.
Studying a deck with two or fewer cards should display a "Not enough cards" message (see the "Not enough cards" section below) and a button to add cards to the deck.
Next button
The Next button appears after the card is flipped.

Study after first card is flipped

Restart prompt
When all cards are finished, a message is shown and the user is offered the opportunity to restart the deck. If the user does not restart the deck, they return to the home screen.

You can use window.confirm() to create the modal dialog shown in the screenshot below.

Study restart prompt

Not enough cards
Studying a Deck with two or fewer cards should display a "Not enough cards" message and a button to add cards to the deck.

Study with not enough cards

Clicking the Add Cards button should take the user to the Add Card screen.

Note: In addition to needing to pass the tests and requirements in the instructions here, please review the Rubric Requirements for the human-graded part of this project in your Thinkful curriculum page.
